Survey™ Project Technical Documentation  
  
This repository is part of the [Survey™ Project development platform](https://github.com/surveyproject). The platform is a [collection of websites](http://www.surveyproject.org) to support and facilitate the development and distribution of the SP™ webapplication.  
  
This repository is used as a Github website [https://surveyproject.github.io/spdocs/] to share and publish the technical documentation for the Survey™ Project WAP Solution. The documentation is autogenerated through Visual Studio by making use of the [DocFX.console](https://www.nuget.org/packages/docfx.console/) nuget package. The resulting static html webpages are published through this repository.  
   
An new (empty ASP.NET webapp) Visual Studio Project was created as part of the Survey™ Project Solution to run DocFX and create html pages from the sourcecode of the  [8] SP projects. 

The sources for the documentation project _DocFx.SurveyProject_ are published to the [SurveyProject repository](https://github.com/surveyproject/surveyproject/tree/sp_25_dev)- (sp_25_dev branche).
